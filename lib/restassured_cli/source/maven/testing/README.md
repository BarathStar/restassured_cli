## About
This testing project is generated by [restassured-cli](https://github.com/eing/restassured-cli).

### To run pre-production tests
 - Tests are run *without* recompiling. Artifacts are downloaded and testng files are extracted.
```
$ cd testing
$ mvn clean install

$ cd testing/<project>-test-runner
$ mvn clean install -U -P ci
$ mvn clean install -U -P qa
$ mvn clean install -U -P e2e
$ mvn clean install -U -P perf
```
 - For non-standard profiles (other than ci, qa, e2e, perf and production), create your own profiles in test-parent-pom.

## Eclipse

* To import testing project into Eclipse :

 - cd testing; mvn eclipse:eclipse

 - File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects > Browse to testing root directory (all selections checked) and click Finish

* To run tests for environments other than qa, e.g. for CI, add **-Dtargetenv=ci** in Run Configurationâ€™s VM arguments/options.
